  We Have Canceled Magma and moved the finishing development date to december. I Have Been Very Busy With School Work & have to focus on that before i focus on making Magma, which i have been developing for about 4 months now. Lots of changes to the old console menu are going to be changed and we will be working on a User Interface for users to have a open field of options also including a overlay menu.
